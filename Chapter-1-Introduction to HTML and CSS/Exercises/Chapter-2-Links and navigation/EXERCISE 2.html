            <p>""Cobra Kai" rejuvenates the famous "Karate Kid" story, exploring the ongoing feud between Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence many years later following their adolescent confrontations. <br>
                 The show, developed by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg, delves into the intricate lives of the characters as they maneuver through adulthood, parenting, and their common past.
                Johnny Lawrence, previously known as a bully, decides to reopen the Cobra Kai dojo in order to find redemption and a sense of direction.
                 At the same time, Daniel LaRusso, who is currently thriving as a car salesman, struggles with his previous experiences and the influence of his teacher, Mr. Miyagi. <br>
                Their competition resumes as they guide new groups of karate students, such as Miguel Diaz and Samantha LaRusso, who become involved in the feud between Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do Karate.
                 The show explores ideas of self-discovery, salvation, and the repetitive patterns of family suffering, set amidst thrilling fight scenes.
                "Cobra Kai" has captured viewers with its mix of nostalgia, engaging narrative, and fully developed characters,
                 establishing itself as a contemporary gem that pays homage to the original movies while also creating its own unique journey. <br>""

            <p>1. 
                The show skillfully follows the narrative of the "The Karate Kid" movies, catching up with the characters like Johnny Lawrence and Daniel LaRusso years after the events in the original films.
                 The story unfolds at a steady pace, blending dynamic martial arts scenes with character-focused drama and comedy.
                 The competition between Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do Karate provides an engaging setting for exploring themes of redemption, guidance, and the challenges of generational trauma.</p>

            <p>2. Just loved it.
                I finished the whole series in just 5 days.
                The story was simple but the way they portrayed it was just just amazing.
                The level of acting done by every individual was brilliant and something that made the
                show even more watchable.
                I liked the characters each one of them.
                A fighter who was bulied for having a limp and he learned how to fight and fought his bullies.</p>
